Howto use the services?
#######################

1. The server needs to be able to register its service. A "namespace::" parameter has to be added to the servers
   parameters. The exact position in the cmdline is unimportant.
   Example: "namespace::/foo".

2. Start the service. It will register itself in the namespace under a known protocol name. The tracebuffer for example
   uses "log".
   Example: "tracebuffer:32768"

3. The client stub has to get access to the name. Add a "name::" parameter to the clients cmdline.
   Example: "name::/foo/log"
