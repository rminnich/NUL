* Usage

** Converting a Presentation

Assuming that you have your presentation as PDF file, you can use the
pdfprepare.py script to create a special data file that rocknshine can
render:

 ./pdfprepare your.pdf rocknshine.data

Although this script has only been tested with PDFs, it should be able
to convert anything ImageMagick can convert.

Note that you might run into trouble, if your converted data file
exceeds a certain limit (see __module_start in linker.ld).

** Presentation

An example of the relevant part of the Pulsar config could be:

 load rocknshine.nova sigma0::mem:48
 load rocknshine.data sigma0::attach

You can use Space, Enter, and the arrow keys to navigate. Pressing 1
jumps to the first slide.

* File Format

** Data Layout

Data is stored in little-endian order (except magic).

|                4 | height   | Height of images in pixels                                      |
|                8 | pages    | number of pages                                                 |
|               12 | offset[] | offset of each page relative to magic (including offset to EOF) |
| 12 + (pages+1)*4 | data     | image data                                                      |

** Hints

The size of each compressed page can be computed by subtracting the
next page's offset from the current offset.
